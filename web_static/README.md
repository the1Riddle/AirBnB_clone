# AirBnB clone - Web static

This is where the front-end implementation will be done for the console

Background Context
----------------------------

**Web static, what?**

Now that my colaborator and I had created a command line interpreter managing the AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!<br>

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.<br>

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

- This simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything

Tha aim of this project is to help manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design.
